/**
 * DEPRECATED: This build script is no longer used
 * 
 * This file created a simple JavaScript bundle that conflicts with the TypeScript application.
 * The TypeScript application now uses Vite for building and bundling.
 * 
 * Use the following commands instead:
 * - npm run build (for production build)
 * - npm run dev (for development)
 * - npm run serve (to serve built application)
 * 
 * This file has been renamed to .deprecated to prevent conflicts.
